# Hello

My name is Pil. Im an embedded developer with a great love for Rust and low level stuff.

This is just a blank canvas for now.

My hope is that i one day can share my many opinions here, instead of bombarding my wife and colleagues constantly, but i make no promises. 

In the meantime, you can get unsolicited advice at:
